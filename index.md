# Apertium-finâ€“Finnish dictionary and RBMT resources

Apertium-fin is a free and open source project containing lexical resources
and some rules, primarily developed for rule-based machine translation, but
can be useful to anyone needing mono-lingual resources for the language.
The dictionaries and rulesets are provided in apertium's own XML format.
